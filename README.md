# StoryTracker

This is NOT READY and WILL NOT DO ANYTHING! Don't download this. Seriously. It's not even at the "alpha" stage, it's at the "I just came up with the idea and have done a tiny bit of coding on it" stage. It does literally nothing except pull some junk data from some JSON files. You can't use it for any purpose. It has no intended purpose right now.

IN THE FUTURE... this will be a downloadable package that allows authors to track their stories and story submissions, and run convenient reports. But it's not that right now. Not yet.
